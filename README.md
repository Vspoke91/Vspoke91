# Welcome to my perfile! 😄

Hello,  
my name is Victor R.  
I'm a developer, and this is my journey 🌏

## My Projects 🚀
I have been creating programs since I was in middle school. Not all of them are finished products, but they were good enough for people to understand what I was building. This section is intended to showcase what I have created since then.

### Web Development 🌐 - current
*Language/s: JavaScript, CSS, HTML*

One of my latest projects is AI World, a website that, given the current growth of AI, provides people with an easier way to find tools that will fit their needs. 🤖

### Software Development 💻
*Language/s: Java*

One of my first "big" projects was a program called **ZombieAnt-RAT**. It was used to control Android devices anywhere in the world by leveraging a port forward from your home WiFi. 🐜

### Game Development 🎮
*Language/s: C#*

After trying software development using Java, I felt comfortable enough to attempt building my own game. One of them was **Infinite Survival**. The game was developed using Unity and was a 2D version of Minecraft. The terrain was created using procedural generation. 🌳

## Who do I want to be? 🤔
Since I received my first computer at around the age of 10, I discovered my passion for computers. I was fascinated by the idea of creating and automating tasks on my computer. To keep the story short, after that first computer, I knew I wanted to be a programmer. Programming/coding, for me, is a way to express my creative side and test my skills as a problem solver. 😊💻
